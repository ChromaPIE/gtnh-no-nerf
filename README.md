# GregTech: New Horizons NO NERF!

A GTNH Mod to prevent nerfs from its team.

I hate the feeling that whatever I liked to play, it gets nerfed in the very next version. So since this mod came out, no more innocent nerfs should take place!

## Re-Buffed

- [X] Disassembler should be there with nothing changed. (GTNewHorizons/GT5-Unofficial#1855)
- [ ] Iron Fence in Lightning Rod structure will no longer be broken in Thunder weather. (GTNewHorizons/GT5-Unofficial#1875)

## Buffed

_Things/features listed here are not being nerfed yet in GTNH, but I think is should be like this._

- [ ] No consume when the Empty Cells pours out its liquid to other containers or the world.

This mod backports **Hammers** in Thermal Series in later versions of Minecraft, and a **Falling Torch** performs like sands.

### [JustEnoughCalculation](https://github.com/Towdium/JustEnoughCalculation/tree/1.7.10)

This mod adds a GUI that can help you calculating the consumes, catalysts, outputs for specified amount of what you are going to craft.

### [NotEnoughElements](https://github.com/ElytraServers/NotEnoughElements)

This mod adds an NEI searching pattern "el:{element}" to filter the items that contains certain element. Very useful when you finding some kind of ore to process.
